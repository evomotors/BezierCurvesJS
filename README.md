# BezierCurvesJS

Bezier curves are the most fundamental curves, used generally in computer graphics and image processing. These curves are mainly used in interpolation, approximation, curve fitting, and object representation. This code shows a very simple and straightforward way to construct Bezier curves and make use of them.

Example:<br/>
var a = [100, 250, 266, 48, 102, 250, 400, 250];<br/>
var b = GetBezierPoints(b,500);
